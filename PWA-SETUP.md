# PWA Setup Guide

## Mobile-First PWA Implementation Complete! üçÇ

Your Westlake Leaf Collection Tracker has been transformed into a fully mobile-optimized Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support and home screen installation capabilities.

## What's Been Added

### 1. PWA Manifest (`/public/manifest.json`)
- App metadata and configuration
- Theme colors matching your green branding
- Icon definitions for all sizes
- Standalone display mode for app-like experience

### 2. Service Worker (`/public/sw.js`)
- **Offline Support**: App works without internet connection
- **Caching Strategy**: 
  - Static assets cached for instant loading
  - API responses cached for offline viewing
  - Automatic cache updates in background
- **Version Management**: Old caches automatically cleaned up

### 3. Mobile-First Design
- **Responsive Layout**: Single column on mobile, two columns on desktop
- **Touch Optimizations**: 
  - Minimum 44x44px touch targets
  - Visual feedback on tap
  - Smooth scrolling with momentum
- **Safe Area Support**: Works perfectly on notched devices (iPhone X+)
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion support for users who prefer it

### 4. Installation Features
- **Install Prompt**: Automatic banner to add app to home screen
- **iOS Support**: Custom instructions for iPhone/iPad users
- **Update Notifications**: Alerts users when new version is available

## Icon Generation

**IMPORTANT**: You need to generate the PWA icons!

1. A browser window should have opened with `generate-icons.html`
2. Click the **"Generate All Icons"** button
3. Your browser will download 8 icon files (icon-72x72.png through icon-512x512.png)
4. Move all downloaded icons to `/public/icons/` folder

If the generator didn't open:
```bash
open generate-icons.html
```

## Testing Your PWA

### On Mobile (Android Chrome)
1. Visit your deployed app
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" prompt or banner
3. Tap "Install" to add to home screen
4. Open from home screen - runs like a native app!

### On Mobile (iOS Safari)
1. Visit your deployed app
2. Tap the Share button (box with arrow)
3. Scroll and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Name it and tap "Add"

### Test Offline Mode
1. Load the app and browse some streets
2. Turn off WiFi/data
3. Refresh the page - it still works!
4. Previously viewed streets are available offline

### Desktop Testing
1. Chrome: Look for install icon in address bar
2. Edge: Same as Chrome
3. Click to install as desktop app

## Lighthouse PWA Score

After deploying, test your PWA score:
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
3. Check "Progressive Web App"
4. Run audit - you should score 100!

## Mobile-First Features

### Touch Improvements
- All buttons are minimum 44px tall (Apple's recommended touch target)
- Active state feedback (slight scale on tap)
- No hover effects on mobile (they're annoying on touch)
- Pull-to-refresh ready (can be enabled in service worker)

### Layout Changes
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: 
  - Single column stack layout
  - Compact header with smaller text
  - Full-width buttons
  - Reduced padding for more content
  
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: 
  - Hybrid layout
  - Medium padding
  
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: 
  - Two-column layout (original design)
  - Full padding
  - Side-by-side details

### Performance Optimizations
- Critical resources preloaded
- Background image optimized
- Animations respect user preferences
- Safe area insets for notched devices

## Files Modified

1. **`/public/index.html`**
   - Added PWA meta tags
   - Mobile-first CSS
   - Service worker registration
   - Install prompt component
   - Responsive header and layout

2. **`/vercel.json`**
   - PWA-specific headers
   - Service worker cache control
   - Security headers

## Files Created

1. `/public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest
2. `/public/sw.js` - Service worker
3. `/generate-icons.html` - Icon generator tool
4. `/public/icons/` - Icon directory (you need to populate this!)

## Vercel Deployment

Your PWA will work automatically on Vercel! The configuration includes:
- Proper MIME types for manifest
- Service worker headers
- Cache control for icons
- Security headers

Just deploy as normal:
```bash
vercel deploy
```

## Browser Support

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Android & Desktop) - Full PWA support
- ‚úÖ Safari (iOS) - Add to Home Screen support
- ‚úÖ Samsung Internet - Full PWA support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Firefox - Service worker works, install prompt limited

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add Push Notifications**: Notify users when their street is being serviced
2. **Background Sync**: Queue API requests when offline, sync when back online
3. **Share Target**: Allow sharing street info to the app
4. **File Handling**: Open leaf pile images directly in the app
5. **Shortcuts**: Quick actions from home screen icon

## Troubleshooting

### Icons not showing?
- Make sure you ran the icon generator
- Check that files are in `/public/icons/`
- Verify manifest.json is being served (check Network tab)

### Service worker not registering?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `/sw.js` is accessible
- Make sure you're on HTTPS (required for PWA)
- Localhost works for testing

### Install prompt not showing?
- Chrome requires HTTPS and manifest
- User must visit site at least twice
- Must wait 30 seconds between visits
- Can't be already installed
- iOS doesn't show automatic prompt (manual only)

### Offline mode not working?
- Load the page at least once while online
- Check service worker is active (DevTools > Application > Service Workers)
- Verify cache storage has entries (Application > Cache Storage)

## Success Indicators

You'll know your PWA is working when:
- ‚úÖ Install prompt appears on mobile
- ‚úÖ App works offline after first load
- ‚úÖ Lighthouse PWA score is 100
- ‚úÖ App opens in standalone mode (no browser UI)
- ‚úÖ Icon appears on home screen
- ‚úÖ Splash screen shows when opening

## Performance Metrics

Expected improvements:
- **First Load**: Similar to before (requires network)
- **Subsequent Loads**: Instant (cached)
- **Offline**: Fully functional with cached data
- **Install Size**: ~200KB total

**Need Help?** Check the browser console for `[PWA]` and `[Service Worker]` logs to see what's happening under the hood.

Enjoy your mobile-first PWA! üéâ
